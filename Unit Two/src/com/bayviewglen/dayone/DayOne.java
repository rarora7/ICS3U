		// index is always length minus 1
		// word.length is a methode
		// word.index of ('p') returns the first value of P 
		// index is where it starts
		// If what you are searching for that is not there it will come out as -1
		// Substring a string within a string
		// word.substring (1,4) it would say lph it would say h in alphabet even though it is the fourth number
		// word.substring(3) would give habet
		// to get middle number you divide by 2
		// Keyboard.nextline reads up until the next space
